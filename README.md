# ![Karumi logo][karumilogo] Kata SuperHeroes with SpringBoot in Kotlin.

- We are here to practice the usage of [SpringBoot].
- We are going to use [Kotlin][kotlin].
- We are going to practice pair programming.

---

## Getting started

This repository contains an SpringBoot application.

## Tasks

Your task as Spring Boot Developer is to **create a rest application*. You will do so step by step and always using tests to verify everything is still working.

Our recommendation for this exercise is:

### Before starting
  1. Checkout `5-functional-approach` branch.

### Exercise
  1. Enable Global Security
  2. Add Delete Endpoint restricted to Admin
  3. Configure authentication with username and password.
  4. Update tests for support roles.

- To verify the correct behavior of your code you can execute:

```shell
./gradlew ktlint test
```
