# ![Karumi logo][karumilogo] Kata SuperHeroes with SpringBoot in Kotlin.

- We are here to practice the usage of [SpringBoot].
- We are going to use [Kotlin][kotlin].
- We are going to practice pair programming.

---

## Getting started

This repository contains an SpringBoot application.

## Tasks

Your task as Spring Boot Developer is to **create a rest application*. You will do so step by step and always using tests to verify everything is still working.

Our recommendation for this exercise is:

### Before starting
  1. Checkout `6-authorization` branch.

### Exercise
  1. Wrap your repository methods with reactive publishers.
  2. Use ResponseStatus annotation to specify return status of post and delete endpoints. 

- To verify the correct behavior of your code you can execute:

```shell
./gradlew ktlint test
```
